RESTful API:- so rest just an architectural style to design API's

REpresentationsal
State
Transfer

In HTTP request may be somebody might hijack our card details..
that's why we can also use cryptography and encrypt our request so if anybody does intercept the request they won't be able to know what it says

HTTP verbs
GET POST PUT PATCH DELETE theses verbs that we should we use to make API RESTful

app.get(READ):- we pass a callback responds the request and sends the result and request related to a database that equivalent searching our database and returning the data as the result 
app.post(CREATE):- whenever we created a form on our website we've used app.post and then we call back with our request and response. When data is posted to our server then we create an entry in our database and we save that data for later so, in this case, the request will contain the data and the response will simply be a success or maybe error code if there is a problem
the next one is PUT and PATCH and they both update our database

PUT: -an order a new  bicycle and  some fault in their handle then we replace the entire bicycle (so updating database by sending an entry to replace to previous one)
and the other option to change a default thing only or what was the only thing that was broken and rest the bike is fine
so change handle is much better to replace entire bicycle so this is the same as a patch
when you sending a patch request to the server then you're only sending the piece of data that needs to be updated.
instead of the entire entry that will be replaced

DELETE(DELETE):- just deleted or destroy a particular piece of data in our database
