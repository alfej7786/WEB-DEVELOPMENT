# WEB-DEVELOPMENT
This repository contains all the files, notes and programs that I created while taking Angela Yu's "[Complete 2022 Web Development Bootcamp]([url](https://www.google.com/search?q=Complete+2022+Web+Development+Bootcamp&rlz=1C1YTUH_enCA1029CA1029&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8))" Course on Udemy. I have also used various other resources to learn web devlopment and have combined all my learnings into this repository.

This repo focuses on both frontend and backend Web Development. I have also added some of my code and notes to this repository along with notes that are provided by the courses that I have taken down the road. This repo also contains questions and challenges that have helped me to strengthen my concepts.
