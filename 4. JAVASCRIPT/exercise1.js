// BMI Calculator Advanced (IF/ELSE)
// Previously, we've created a function that is able to calculate the BMI. But once we get a result, we will want to tell the user what the number means.
// Write a function that outputs (returns) a different message depending on the BMI.

// BMI <18.5, the output should be: "Your BMI is <bmi>, so you are underweight."
// BMI 18.5-24.9, the output should be "Your BMI is <bmi>, so you have a normal weight."
// BMI >24.9, the output should be "Your BMI is <bmi>, so you are overweight."

// The message MUST be returned as an output from your function. You should NOT NEED to use alert, prompt or console.log in this challenge.
// IMPORTANT the message wording has to match precisely for the code to pass the validation. Including punctuation and capitalisation.

function bmiCalculator (weight, height) {
    var interpretation;
    interpretation = weight / (height * height);

    if (interpretation < 18.5) {
        console.log("Your BMI is" + interpretation, "so you are underweight.");
    }
    if (interpretation >= 18.5 && interpretation >= 24.9) {
        console.log("Your BMI is" + interpretation, "so you have a normal weight.");
    }
    else {
        console.log("Your BMI is" + interpretation, "so you are overweight.");
    }
    return interpretation;
};
